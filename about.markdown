I started software development at the age of 10 in my parents' living  room in Madagascar with the only help of a big stack of Computer Science books that my uncle gave me. 

I studied Computer Science at the University of Paris Saclay/Orsay (picture below taken during my Thesis presentation related to [XML Structuration using RDF of Complex Data for DataMining](/assets/about/Master-Thesis-in-Resource-Description-Framework.pdf)) and specialized in IT Architecture Design & Middleware at Télécom Paris (where I released another Thesis about the [Usage of Interactive Avatar for CRM on the Web](/assets/about/Post-Master-CRMusingInteractiveAvatar.pdf)).

Today, I am realizing my passion as a Managing Architect designing and implementing Enterprise  Solutions using Application Programming Interface, Big Data Analytics,  Business Process Management, Complex Event Processing, Hybrid-Cloud  Integration, Master Data Management, Service-Oriented Architecture and  Process Automation. 

My day to day job is to make sure that my  customer’s projects are successful, fulfilling business needs in terms  of solutions & services and delivering tangible outcomes. I created this blog based on the experience that I acquired in Integration, API Management, Observability & Application Performance Management.
