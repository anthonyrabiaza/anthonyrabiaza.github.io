I started software development at the age of 12 in my parents' living  room in Madagascar with the only help of a big stack of Computer Science books that my uncle gave me. 

Today, I am realizing my passion  as a Software/System Architect designing and implementing Enterprise  Solutions using Application Programming Interface, Big Data Analytics,  Business Process Management, Complex Event Processing, Hybrid-Cloud  Integration, Master Data Management, Service-Oriented Architecture and  Process Automation. 

My day to day job is to make sure that my  customerâ€™s projects are successful, fulfilling business needs in terms  of solutions & services and delivering tangible outcomes. I created this blog based on the experience that I acquired in Integration, API Management, Application Performance Management & Monitoring.
